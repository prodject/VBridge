# TurnBridge

**TurnBridge** is annetwork utility. It allows you to securely route your iOS network traffic through TURN servers and WireGuard / Amnezia WG endpoints.

To run the application, you must use a [server](https://github.com/cacggghp/vk-turn-proxy/releases/tag/v1.0.0) running on a VPS.

The project is based on the repositories listed in the **Acknowledgments** section.

## ✨ Features

* **Custom Routing:** Route your traffic through specific TURN protocols and WG endpoints.
* **WireGuard & Amnezia WG Integration:**
  - Complete WireGuard protocol support with key management, routing, and DNS configuration
  - Full Amnezia WireGuard obfuscation support including jitter parameters (Jc, Jmin, Jmax), packet size obfuscation (S1-S4), and magic headers (H1-H4)
* **1-Click Import:** Quickly import complex configurations via base64-encoded clipboard links (`turnbridge://`).
* **Multi-Profile Management:** Create, edit, and seamlessly switch between multiple VPN configurations using a convenient dropdown picker.

## 🚀 Installation & Build

To build and run TurnBridge locally, you need a macOS environment with Xcode installed, as well as Go (for compiling the WireGuard/TURN bridge).

> ⚠️ **Important:** TurnBridge uses a Network Extension (VPN). Signing with a **free Apple ID** (via standard AltStore or Sideloadly) **will not work** because free accounts lack the required VPN entitlements. You must use a paid Apple Developer account ($99/year) or a third-party paid signing service.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nullcstring/turnbridge.git
   cd TurnBridge
   ```

2. **Build the Go Bridge:**
Ensure you have Go installed (`brew install go`).

Modify the Go path in the script at script/build_wireguard_go_bridge.sh, according to your setup. Refer to [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64212121) for guidance.

3. **Open the project in Xcode:**
Open `TurnBridge.xcodeproj` (or `.xcworkspace` if applicable) in Xcode.
4. **Configure Code Signing:**
* Select the `TurnBridge` project in the Project Navigator.
* Go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
* Select your personal Apple Developer Team.
* Ensure you update the Bundle Identifier (for both the main app and the `network-extension` target) to match your team provisioning profile.

5. **Build and Run:**
Select your target device (iPhone/iPad) and press `Cmd + R` to build and run the app.

## 📲 Install Pre-built IPA (No Xcode Required)

If you don't have a Mac or Xcode, you can download the pre-built unsigned IPA from the [Releases](https://github.com/nullcstring/turnbridge/releases) page and sign it yourself.

### Signing & Installation

**Manual Installation Tools:**
If you already possess a paid Apple Developer certificate (or bought one from the services above), you can sign and install the IPA yourself using:

| Tool | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| [KravaSign](https://www.kravasign.com/) | ⚠️ Without a developer certificate, price $10 https://github.com/nullcstring/turnbridge/issues/2#issuecomment-4129716584 |
| [GBox](https://gbox.run) | Paid Certificate Needed |
| [ESign](https://esign.yyyue.xyz) | Paid Certificate Needed |


## 🛠 Usage (Configuration Import)

TurnBridge uses a specific JSON structure encoded in Base64 for fast configuration imports for WireGuard / Amnezia WG.

### Configuration JSON Structure

```json
{
  "turn": "https://vk.com/call/join/...",
  "peer": "SERVER_IP:PORT",
  "listen": "127.0.0.1:9000",
  "n": 1,
  "wg": "[Interface]\nPrivateKey = ...\nAddress = 10.100.0.2/32\nDNS = 8.8.8.8\nMTU = 1280\n\n[Peer]\nPublicKey = ...\nAllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0\nEndpoint = 127.0.0.1:9000\nPersistentKeepalive = 25"
}
```

### Generate a Quick Import Link

You can use the included `quick_link.py` script to easily generate valid `turnbridge://` clipboard links.

1. Open `quick_link.py` in your text editor and replace the placeholder values in the `config` dictionary with your actual server parameters and WireGuard keys.
2. Run the script from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 quick_link.py
   ```

3. Copy the generated `turnbridge://...` link from the terminal output to your iOS clipboard.
4. Open TurnBridge, tap the `+` icon, select **Paste from Clipboard**, and tap **Connect**.
